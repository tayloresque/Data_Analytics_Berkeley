Multi Year Stock Data Instructions

1. First I declared a variable for worksheets to use in a loop, which will cycle through everything that comes after that across all sheets.
2. Then I created headers and assigned my variables.
3. Then I created a For loop to cycle through the tickers and goes through a series of functions for each unique value. I calculated the yearly change, percent change, and total volume, and then printed those outputs. Then I applied conditional formatting to the yearly change column.
4. When the value does equal the value the macro is on in the for loop, then it continues to add the volume in that row.
5. After the for loop is complete, then look at the table we just created to identify the greatest increase, greatest decrease, and highest volume, and print those in another table.
